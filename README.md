# Openstack Front-End

A [frontend for Openstack](./gui) using Nana and TinyXML2, as well as a [server](./server) [client](./client) architecture using Boost Asio and MySQL.

# Disclaimer

This project is just a proof of concept of the software architecture proposed in the bachelor thesis "OpenStack Front-End zur dynamischen Verwaltung
virtueller Maschinen mit graphischen Interface" by John-Dean Mochow. The title of the thesis can be loosely translated as "OpenStack front-end for the dynamic management of 
virtual machines using a graphical interface".

As such it is in no shape or form feature-complete or bug-free. The code base is provided as is with no future plans of modification in any way.
